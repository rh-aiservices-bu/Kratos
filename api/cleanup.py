"""Manual "Clean Up Now" execution — runs a run's task cleanup() methods
in-process, inside the API server, after the harness Job pod that originally
ran it has already exited.

This reuses harness/tasks/*.py's own cleanup() implementations directly
(same container image as the harness Job, ADR-001) rather than re-implementing
key revocation / CR restore-or-delete here: none of those cleanup() methods
read self.params (confirmed by inspection — every self.params access lives in
run(), never cleanup()), so a bare TaskClass(name=name, params={}) reproduces
the exact same cleanup call the harness's own end-of-run loop would have made,
driven by whatever shared_state the original run persisted (see
harness/cleanup_state.py) instead of a live in-memory dict.
