# ADR-005: Two-level Tiered Configuration (Global ConfigMap + Scenario YAML)

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Kratos needs configuration at two distinct scopes:

1. **Cluster-level**: the MaaS API base URL, default model, and default subscription. These are the same for every scenario run on a given cluster and should not need to be repeated in every scenario file.
2. **Scenario-level**: run parameters specific to a scenario (request count, concurrency, rate limit, target URL, etc.). These vary per scenario and should be tunable without touching cluster-wide settings.

Options considered:

- **Single flat ConfigMap**: all settings in one place, merged at deploy time. Makes per-scenario tuning awkward.
- **Environment variables only**: no YAML scenario config; everything is an env var. Inflexible; can't version scenario configs alongside code.
- **Two-level merge**: a global ConfigMap provides cluster-level defaults as env vars; each scenario YAML has a `config:` section for scenario-level params. Scenario YAML values take precedence where keys overlap.

## Decision

Use a **two-level tiered configuration**:

1. **Global ConfigMap** (`configmap-global.yaml`) — injected as environment variables into every Job pod. Contains only cluster-level settings:
   ```yaml
   MAAS_API_URL: "https://maas.apps.mycluster.example.com"
   DEFAULT_MODEL: "granite-3-8b-instruct"
   DEFAULT_SUBSCRIPTION: ""   # empty = auto-select highest priority
   ```

2. **Scenario YAML `config:` section** — per-scenario parameters with sensible defaults. Resolved at runtime by the harness config loader. Scenario values override globals where keys overlap.

Scenario YAML params are referenced in task `params` using `${config.<key>}` interpolation.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Cluster operators set the global ConfigMap once; scenario authors never need to know the cluster domain or model name.
- Scenario configs ship with defaults so a run works out of the box without requiring the user to set any values before triggering.
- Scenario YAML files are self-documenting: reading the `config:` section tells you exactly what parameters the scenario accepts and what the defaults are.
- No hard ceilings — users can override any scenario config value to any number they want.

**Negative:**
- Two places to look when debugging a config problem: the ConfigMap and the scenario YAML.
- The interpolation syntax (`${config.<key>}`) must be implemented and tested in the harness config loader.

**Neutral:**
- The global ConfigMap intentionally contains no scenario-specific values (request counts, rate limits, etc.). Those live exclusively in the scenario YAML `config:` section.
